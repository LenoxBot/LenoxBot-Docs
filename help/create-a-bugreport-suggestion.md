# Create a bugreport/suggestion

You want to create a bugreport or a suggestion? No problem! Visit our Discord Server on  [lenoxbot.com/discord](https://t.co/dPliBxYY7O)!

 

### How can I create a suggestion or a bug ?

Whenever you found a bug or have a suggestion , let us know using  the command`?createissue` in `#create-issues`. Then the bot will ask you some questions to ensure that we can understand all the details about your issue.



### What  **happens after** creating an issue ?

After creating an issue the "**Issue Judger**" can approve or decline your issue in `#processing-suggestions` or `#processing-bugreports`

If your issue has been accepted, the bot will send you a message and give you 200 credits and add five points in your statistics.

If your issue has been declined, the bot will send you a message and remove one point in your statistics.



### How can I become an **Issue Judger ?**

Issue Judger you'll become once you have reached 50 points. Your points could you see with `?stats` in `#create-issues`

For every accepted issue, the bot add 5 points in your statistics and for every declined issue, the bot will remove you one point in your statistics.
