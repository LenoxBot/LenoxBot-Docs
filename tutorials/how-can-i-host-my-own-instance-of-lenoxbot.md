# Own instance of LenoxBot

Because we have an [open source project on GitHub,](https://github.com/lenoxbot/lenoxbot.git) you have the possibility to have your own instance of LenoxBot. We offer you a complete tutorial on how to install your own instance on Windows and Linux/Debian:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
You must have already installed **NPM**, **Git**, **NodeJS, MongoDB Server** and **FFmpeg**! There are many tutorials online on how to install all these packages for your operating system.

1. Clone this repository \(Branch: **Master**\)
   * Execute `git clone https://github.com/LenoxBot/LenoxBot.git --branch master`
2. Now you have to execute a few commands in the folder in which you cloned LenoxBot:
   * `npm -g --add-python-to-path install windows-build-tools node-gyp`
   * `npm i --global --production windows-build-tools`
   * `npm install`
3. Now you should have a folder called `node_modules`. In this folder are now all your installed packages.
4. Now you have to rename your `settings_example.json`, file located in the main folder to `settings.json`. Now enter your Discord Top Secret Token and all other information that is asked.
5. You can run the bot using the command `node lenoxbotlauncher.js`

To invite the bot on your Discord server, copy the Client ID of your bot application that you find [**here**](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) if you click on the application:

Now you can create an invite link for your bot [**here**](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) for example.
