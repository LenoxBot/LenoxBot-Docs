# What’s a translator?
Translators are **volunteers** who are contributing to the [LenoxBot localization project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lenoxbot) and who are helping to facilitate using the LenoxBot for people **speaking different languages** in this way. Therefore, they **translate** every message of the Bot into one or more of our aim languages and **vote** for translations suggested by other users to **facilitate** the work of the proofreaders. Translators are not members of the LenoxBot staff.

# What’s a translation proofreader?
Proofreaders are staff members who are responsible for an **appropriate translation** in their aim language. All of them have to **proofread translations** and provide the best translation quality for their specific aim languages. Some of them also have **additional tasks**, e.g. keeping a list of common translations to **provide consistency** in their aim language. Translations proofreaders are active translators chosen by the translation leader DanNick; that’s why you cannot apply as a proofreader.

# How can I participate at LenoxBot translation and become a translator?
To “become” a translator, you just have to **be on our [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/c7DUz35 “Invitation to the LenoxBot Discord server”)** and execute `?join Translator` in #spam. To start translation, you have to **[sign up for Crowdin]( https://crowdin.com/join)** and use [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/lenoxbot “LenoxBot localization project in Crowdin”) to get redirected to our project.
To get started, we recommend you to have a look at the **[Crowdin translation tour](https://crowdin.com/page/tour#tab_translators “Translation & proofreading tour by Crowdin”)**, where every important feature is described clearly.

# Can I lose my translation role? What will happen with trolls?
If you are **inactive** for a certain time, you may **lose** your translation role on the Discord server. If you want to continue translation, just **re-assign** it yourself.
Whenever people think that our Crowdin project is a place to **troll** and to **play up**, all their translations may get **deleted** and they may get **blocked** from the translation project. But don’t worry, if you just want to help us localize the bot, this won’t happen to you.

So, what are you waiting for? We’re happy about every single user who has the time and the motivation to help us. Maybe you will become a proofreader one day?
