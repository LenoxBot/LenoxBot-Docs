# My credits are gone

Rarely it happens that credits just disappear, so we need precise information what you have previously entered as a command to investigate the problem.

That's why we ask you to create a ticket \(**?ticket**\) on the LenoxBot Discord Server with the following informations:

1. **Your Discord username** 
2. **Your Discord user ID**
3. **When did you have your credits?** 
4. **Which command\(s\) did you use before your credits disappear?**

{% hint style="info" %}
In any case, in which the credits have disappeared, we will refund them, so don't worry about that!
{% endhint %}
